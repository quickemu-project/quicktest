This test merely loops forever, taking a screenshot when asked
The goal of this is for you to manually run the distro or release you wish to test, 
and press [return] in the terminal window, whenever you wish to take a screenshot.
This script will take a screenshot, and then wait for you to press [return] again.
After taking the screeshot, it will run tesseract to turn the image into text.
This is useful if you wish to gather screenshots and text for a new distro, or
release, or language. You can then use this text to create a new test script.
